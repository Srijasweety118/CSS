        <p> <img src="./images/4minar.jpg" alt="nill" style="width:200px; height: 190px; margin-right:10px;"> <font color="blue"> Dubbed the Arc de Triomphe of the east and Hyderabad’s most iconic structure, Charminar, was built to mark the eradication of the epidemic cholera that had ravaged the city in the 16th century. Lying on the east bank of the Musi river with the Laad Bazaar to its west and Makkah Masjid to the south-west, Charminar is a cultural and historical landmark that translates into four minars or pillars in Urdu. The area around the monument is also referred to as Charminar, and for a first-timer a tour of the Nizam city is incomplete without taking in the infectious energy of the place where it all began. Albeit traffic-ridden, the bazaars are still chaotic with their labyrinthine by-lanes heaving with hawkers, bangle sellers and food stalls.

            The Charminar was built in 1591 after Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth king of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, moved his capital from Golconda, due to shortage of water, to Hyderabad city. Listed under the Archaeological Survey of India, theories abound on the reason for the construction of the Charminar. However, the two most probable ones historians rely on include the moving of capitals from Golconda to Hyderabad under Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah who prayed for the end of Cholera that had caused many deaths in his city, and had taken an oath to build a mosque on the site in which he prayed. Marking the end of the plague, Charminar stands on the very site. Persian texts, on the other hand, refer to a narration by a French traveller from the 17th century to the commemoration of the beginning of Islam’s second millennium year 1000 AH as the reason for the construction of the Charminar in 1591.
            
            It is no surprise that the old city of Hyderabad came up around the Charminar, and its strategic positioning at the intersection of historical trade routes that connects the port city of Machilipatnam with the markets of Golconda.</font>

        <p> <img src="./images/tajmahal.webp" alt="" style="height:180px ; margin-right: 5px;"> <font color="brown"> The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

            Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.
            
            The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being “the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world’s heritage”. It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India’s rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.</font></p>
