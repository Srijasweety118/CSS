            <p>A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.[1] Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may be also be graphical. They are a kind of computer language.

The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

Programming language theory is a subfield of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.

                Broadly speaking, you can say that hackers attempt to break into computers and networks for any of four reasons.

<br> There's criminal financial gain, meaning the theft of credit card numbers or defrauding banking systems.
Next, <br> gaining street cred and burnishing one's reputation within hacker subculture motivates some hackers as they leave <br> their mark on websites they vandalize as proof that they pulled off the hack.
Then there's corporate espionage, when one  company's hackers seek to steal information on a competitor's products and services to gain a marketplace advantage.
<br> Finally, entire nations engage in state-sponsored hacking to steal business and/or national intelligence, to
 destabilize their  adversaries' infrastructure, or even to sow discord and confusion in the target country. 
 (There's consensus that China  and Russia have carried out such attacks, including one on Forbes.com. 
 In addition, the recent attacks on the Democratic  National Committee [DNC] made the news in a big wayâ€”especially
